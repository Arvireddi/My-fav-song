       <h1>MY FAVOURITE SONG</h1>
       <hr/>
       <h3>My Heart Will Go On</h3>
       <hr/>
       <pre>
       <b> Every night in my dreams</b>
        I see you, I feel you
        That is how I know you go on

        <b>Far across the distance</b>
        And spaces between us
        You have come to show you go on

        <b>Near, far, wherever you are</b>
        I believe that the heart does go on
        Once more, you open the door
        And you're here in my heart
        And my heart will go on and on

        <b>Love can touch us one time</b>
        And last for a lifetime
        And never let go 'til we're gone

        <b>Love was when I loved you</b>
        One true time I'd hold to
        In my life, we'll always go on

        <b>Near, far, wherever you are</b>
        I believe that the heart does go on (why does the heart go on?)
        Once more, you open the door
        And you're here in my heart
        And my heart will go on and on

        <b>You're here, there's nothing I fear</b>
        And I know that my heart will go on
        We'll stay forever this way
        You are safe in my heart and
        My heart will go on and on
       </pre>
